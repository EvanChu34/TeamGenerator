different information and will be displayed differently. Some general questions that are shared between the 
categories have to do with name, email and what title are they. In the Manager questions, the user will be 
asked what office they are in. In the Engineer questions, the user will be asked what their Github account is.
In the Intern questions, the user will be asked what school the intern attends
