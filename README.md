## About

Team Generator is an application that allows managers to create a active roster of engineers and Interns

add as many teammates they would like. Once the user is done, the application will give a HTML File dis
-playing all the teammates and information.


## Context

	

## Setup Requirements 

The user must first set up:
	- inquirer
	- jest


## User Input
The user will be able to put information in 3 choices: manager, engineers, and interns. Each role requires
different information and will be displayed differently. Some general questions that are shared between the 
categories have to do with name, email and what title are they. In the Manager questions, the user will be 
asked what office they are in. In the Engineer questions, the user will be asked what their Github account is.
In the Intern questions, the user will be asked what school the intern attends
